# Python Programs: Even or Odd & Sum of Integers

## **Overview**
This repository contains two simple Python programs:

1. **Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**  
2. **Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop**  

Each program takes user input or performs calculations and displays the expected output.

## **Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**  
**Filename:** `Task1.py`  

### **Description**  
This program takes an integer input from the user and determines whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` condition.  

### **Usage**  
Run the script and enter an integer when prompted. The program will check and print whether it is even or odd.  

### **Example Output**  
```d
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.
```
```d
Enter a number: 10
10 is an even number.
```

## **Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop**  
**Filename:** `Task2.py`  

### **Description**  
This program uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50 and calculates the sum of all integers in this range. It then displays the final sum.  

### **Usage**  
Run the script, and it will automatically compute and display the sum of integers from 1 to 50.  

### **Example Output**  
```d
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```
